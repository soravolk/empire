# Empire

An planner app to improve yourself

## Development

For setup instructions, please refer to the README files in the respective directories:

- [web/README.md](./web/README.md) for the frontend
- [backend/README.md](./backend/README.md) for the backend

**Note:** You need to set up both the frontend and backend, as some environment variables (such as `REACT_APP_API_URL` and `FRONTEND_URL`) are dependent on each other.
